            Hello!
            <br>
            My name is <strong>Alexander Cormier</strong>, and I go by Xander. I am a junior in <a href="https://www.acalanes.k12.ca.us/laslomas" target="_blank">Las Lomas High School</a>, and I live in Walnut Creek. I have an interest in computer science, music, and math.
            Aside from my various hobbies, I love to spend time working on my academics, with my family, or in my community! 
            <br>
            I have been on my schools' honor roll since 6th grade, while also juggling homework with my life outside of school. I am in <a href="https://www.boysteamcharity.org/" target="_blank">boys team charity</a>, which is a group of kids in grades 8-12 that volunteer in various places around the county. I am a part of the quiz bowl club in my school, which is a club based around academic competition with other people and schools.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-header">ABOUT ME</h2>
        <img class="code-image" src="Images/code.jpg">
        <p>           
        Since I was a kid, I was always interested in things like video games and computers. Soon, I developed a desire to start making, instead of playing them. I took a class on coding when I was in 8th grade, which really sparked my intrigue for them. Now, I am learning more about it than ever before, and I am inspired to go into college studying coding and video games.
        <br>
        Cello is another passion of mine, in which I started when I was five. Over the last 10 (almost eleven!) years I learnt many new and interesting songs and techniques, and even dabbled in arranging music! I am part of both the <a href="https://contracostachamberorchestra.org/" target="_blank">Contra Costa Chamber Orchestra</a>, the Center For Community Arts Cello Ensemble, which is a group of cello players that are all in high school and preform at various concerts and events, and I also am the first chair cellist in my school's orchestra. Other groups I am a part of are the <a href="https://www.ypsomusic.org/" target="_blank">The Young People's Symphony Orchestra</a>, and the East Bay Chamber Orchestra.
        <br>
        </p>
        <p>
        My cello teacher is Stephen Evens, who has a BA in Cello Preformance and a MA in Orchestra Performance. He leads my Cello Ensemble, and is a great mentor for all his students. He can be contacted at stephen.evans29@gmail.com.
        <br>
        Me and a few friends from my school orchestra formed a chamber group together. We are playing in various events and places, such as retirement homes, parties, and outside in downtown. We consist of:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Andrew Park - Violin 1</li>
                <li>Ethan Jacoby - Violin 2</li>
                <li>Alexander Cormier - Cello</li>
                <li>Tre Johnson - Bass</li> 
            </ul>

        <h3>Interesting Careers</h3>
        <p>Careers that are really interesting to me are ones that involve computer sciences. Video Game Designers seem the most interesting because of how diverse the job is, and how all of it is related to the making and designing of games. Some secondary careers that I may consider are being a Musician, as although it doesn't make a lot of money and it is not very stable, music is still something that I love deeply.</p>
